Can you predict which folders educational content should appear in?


## Tooling provided in `sample-notebook-data-exploration.ipynb`:

- Topic = folder
  - children: list of subtopics = subfolders
  - content: list of content items
 
- ContentItem = content nodes (htmlapp, video, audio, document, etc.) 
  - `topics`: which topics am I included in
  - `get_all_breadcrumbs`: full path to each of topics
